<h2 id="intro-and-rules">Intro and Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Main goals: spark your interest, and have fun!</p></li>
<li><p>Most data are not related to computer science. Focus on datavis as a swiss army knife for data science in general. This means...</p>
<ul>
<li>Politics, social studies, economics, science in general. Tools to help other scientists in their work, or relevant for the public at large (information, education, dissemination, etc).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Choose a dataset, and sketch a design proposal before June 3rd. (Be aware - not a lot of time!)</p></li>
<li><p>You will present your design proposal to the class. Expect feedback!</p></li>
<li><p>Fancy to propose a dataset/topic of your choice? OK, but write to us ASAP so that we can check it, and we can either give you a green light or tell you to choose something else instead.</p></li>
<li><p>It will not be required to be experts in all these fields, obviously. But curiosity and effort on your part will be part of the game.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful about data preprocessing and preparation - for a lot of these datasets, it may be time consuming, either by hand, using excel, a scripting language of your choice, or a combination of all the above.</p></li>
<li><p>The amount of data preparation needed will be taken into account when grading final results.</p></li>

<p>The dataset presents information relating to students enrolled at the University of Genoa from 2012 to 2018. You can choose to compute analysis related to a single year and/or analysis over several years.</p>
<p>Student's information is presented in 3 datasets:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Personal information</li>
<li>Enrolment and Degree</li>
<li>Exams information</li>
</ol>
<p>These three data sets could be visualized both separately and together. You can join the information in the three data sets in order to have a global idea of each single student university path. You can also make a lot of comparisons reagarding any type of variable in the datasets. It is a wide range of information: you can play around as you like.</p>

<p>Topic: Human-Computer Interaction</p>
<p>The dataset presents the 3D positions of the thumbs and the index when performing a grasp action in immersive VR. Different objects are randomly presented and 3D positions collected for the entire duration of the action (rest, planning, grasp, movement and release).</p>
<p>Available data are text files containg the temporal sequence of acquired 3D positions of two fingers (thumb and forefinger).</p>
<p>This dataset is best managed in the context of a combined DV-CGAR project, where also the 3D visualization of data and related trajectories is addressed. A simplified DV-only version is possible by addressing data just as time series and deriving data such as statistics, velocities, etc.</p>
<p>Vis scope: time series, 3D</p>

<p>Tog is a no-profit organization. It has founded a rehabilitation center for children with complex neurological pathologies. Opendot is developing for them a suite of eye-tracking based games. The children will be able to play and care givers to control and monitor the experience. The game controls for the children work through eye tracking only on a desktop computer. Therapists control game parameters and the interactive experience as a whole using a control panel on a separate tablet.</p>
<p>A visualization tool for the data generated and collected during a gaming session would help therapist and data scientists to evaluate afterwards the general quality of a gaming session with a child. The data collected has high granularity, registering all low level changes in the rendered scene and all the gaze raw data used as input.</p>
<p>On the one hand, a tool could load a single track and allow for a granular evaluation of the quality of interactions during it. The right balance must be found though, because displaying only the low level stuff without highlighting the correlations hidden between different data flows would not be useful.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a tool could load and visualize multiple sessions in order to evaluate groups of them as a whole and compare them. This would enable complex tasks such as understanding at a glance if during multiple sessions a child becomes more engaged with a game and better at playing it, or a comparison of common traits and issues during game play related to different pathologies in different children.</p>
<p>A comprehensive tool could also aim to solve the zooming problems intrinsic in the presentation of such high granularity data.</p>
<p>Solving all these overlapping goals might be too ambitious for a single course project. It might make sense to focus on specific aspects and to consider a narrower scope. Discuss these issues with your professor and lab assistant before starting your work.</p>
<p>Data: csv and json files will provide periodic samples of the game data and eye tracking input, plus high level events. Some form of data correlation, fusion and/or elaboration will be necessary.</p>
<p>Vis scope: time series</p>
<p>Difficulty: high. Recommended for 2-3 people.</p>

<p>suggested by Luigi Rocca / Dotdotdot luigi@dotdotdot.it</p>
<p>The aim is to build a narrative tool that tells the story of a sea cruise using the data collected during the cruise. Optional integration with additional, external data is welcome: for example, weather data from external stations (this is how we collected this type of data for the mockup csv), astronomical data (sunset/sunrise, sun height during the day, moon rising/setting and phases).</p>
<p>Right now, we are giving you a mockup dataset, because the system for collecting data from the ship is not yet live and running. We will provide real data as it becomes available, and we might expand the mockup data if possible (right now it's just a subset of all possible data fields that we are envisioning). In particular, the mock up dataset still misses: water depth and the cruise guests biometric data.</p>
<p>Data: a csv file containing time series data for the provided variables.</p>
<p>Vis scope: time series</p>
<p>Difficulty: easy, with caveats (developing a &quot;standard&quot; visualization tool should be quite straightforward. The challenge is trying to do something that is aesthetically pleasing and strives toward the goal of unfolding a narrative story through the data).</p>

<p>Topic: health and cognitive sciences</p>
<p>This dataset is clean and very well structured, yet rather different from the others: it consists of a collection of jpg images (all with the same format). There are color images that provide the stimulus for experiments; fixation b/w images where the (sparse) white pixels correspond to fixation points from the observer; fixation greylevel maps that difuse data from the previous: intensity correspond to zones where fixation is most likely to occur; and modified stimulus images where zones of missing attention for color-blind subjects are recolored artificially.</p>
<p>The dataset comes with a paper describing the underlying study.</p>
<p>With a bit of trivial preprocessing (perhaps incorporating a javascript library for images) you can extract tabular data, make statistics and work with visualization techniques a little different from the usual. Possibilities to experiment with heatmaps and color models.</p>

<p>Nutritional choices in online groceries.</p>
<ul>
<li>500 participants.</li>
<li>2 different shoppings, 15/20 products on average per each shopping.</li>
<li>data about the participants: sex, age, demography, nutritional quiz.</li>
<li>data about the products: nutritional values, type of labeling, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The participants perform their shopping in two different conditions. In the first case, the products are labeled using &quot;reference intake labeling&quot; and in the second case, using &quot;multiple traffic lights&quot; labels.</p>
<p>On Aulaweb you will find, as provided by the authors: A description and license for the data, a paper (in French, sorry about this) and a presentation (in English, and it should be more than enough if you don't speak French).</p>
<p>There are two different datasets combined into one: a clean one with just the final purchased items, and a bigger one with all the interface clicks (including searches, items seen but not chosen, items selected and then deleted, etc).</p>
<p>The full data set contains ~70k items. The clean data set can be otained by filtering using the condition (bought == 1), which should give ~9k items.</p>
<p>The data set is in RData format. To convert it to csv, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13189467/how-to-convert-rdata-format-into-text-file-format" class="uri">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13189467/how-to-convert-rdata-format-into-text-file-format</a></p>

<p>The uploaded version omits a file in h5 format and a sample python script to use it. I will provide it to you in the full version, but I think that we can safely ignore this - as far as I understand, its use should be in experiments about consumption disaggregation (e.g, to understand individual appliances consumption knowing only the aggregate consumption and the list of present appliances - see <a href="https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk" class="uri">https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk</a> if you are curious about it, but keep in mind it is not required at all to work with this too).</p>

<p>Suggested by Matteo Fontana.</p>
<p>Topic: climate science and predictive modeling.</p>
<p>A new framework that the climate change research community has adopted to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The framework is known as SSP-IAM.</p>
<p>SSPs are basically &quot;stories&quot; about the world: qualitative description of very broad patterns of developement.</p>
<p>Starting from these scenarios, five different Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are used to simulate what will happen in the future in terms of environmental and economic variables.</p>
<p>7 scenarios (SSPs), 5 models (IAMs), 35 different predictions about the world in total.</p>
<p>The database includes data for every decade from 2010 to 2100, and for every scenario and model, data about:</p>
<ul>
<li>GDP</li>
<li>Population</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Land Cover</li>
<li>Emissions</li>

<li>Massively multivariate data</li>
<li>Sparse Functional Data</li>
<li>Spatial Data</li>
</ul>
<p>Disclaimer: very interesting but complex database. If you choose this one, there will be a requirement to somehow &quot;open the black box&quot; of the database, at least in part. Documentation is not obvious. It will probably make sense to plan for the visualization of a subset of variables, and/or to exploit somehow the inner simmetry (35 different series of the same variables across the same time spans). An initial data analysis phase may be required.</p>

<p>Start from the sun on wikidata and navigate all the solar system bodies using the API and the parent/child relation to obtain all the data you might need: <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q525" class="uri">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q525</a></p>
<p>Other possible questions that a good interactive infographic could solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where is most of the mass of the solar system?</li>
<li>Who's bigger between Pluto, our Moon, and Mercury?</li>
<li>Bigger by mass, surface, or volume?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sports-sports-sports">Sports, sports, sports</h3>
<p>Sports are missing from the current selection of proposed data sets.</p>
<p>Soccer, NBA, Olympics, world records, world events, historical series, markets - there are endless possibilities.</p>
<p>If you can find a database about a discipline or event you are passionate about, just write me and submit a proposal.</p>
<p>Wikidata could be a good starting point in general.</p>
<h3 id="the-heliosphere-solar-winds-and-the-interplanetary-magnetic-field">The heliosphere, solar winds and the interplanetary magnetic field</h3>
<p>Data by NASA about the heliosphere, solar winds and interplanetary magnetic field at different temporal resolutions (1 min and up) from 1963 to today, as collected by various satellites, in a single database. Visualization of temporal series may be performed - see instructions about the data and how to download and process it. Links:</p>
